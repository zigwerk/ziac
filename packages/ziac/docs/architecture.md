# Ziac Architecture

Ziac is a separate package from zigeffect. zigeffect provides effects, layers,
structured concurrency, scopes, and causal traces. zigeffect-std provides the
application-facing standard library facade that Ziac imports as its substrate.

Ziac provides the IaC product layer: stacks, resources, outputs, providers,
state, plans, applies, and component libraries.

Initial source domains:

- `core.zig`: names, IDs, physical names, diagnostics.
- `output.zig`: lazy outputs and secret references.
- `resource.zig`: resource graph and dependency validation.
- `state.zig`: resource state records and in-memory store.
- `plan.zig`: deterministic plan operations.
- `provider.zig`: provider lifecycle vtable and fake provider.
- `apply.zig`: plan executor.

Provider implementations must sit behind the provider lifecycle interface so the
engine can be tested without live cloud credentials.
